In order to run my programs I like to locate the directory where management_service.py and monitoring_service.py is in my terminal.

Then I would first startup the monitoring_service.py in one terminal

It will display server is "listening for incoming connections..."

If it doesn't you may have to change the port number in both the monitoring_service and management_service so they match
with a different number

After getting the server running, you would open up another terminal

You will then locate the directory in which the python files are stored again and begin running management_services.py

This begins the program!

Once you have it running you have a couple of command options that are provided to you.

"0-EXIT, 1-Create Configuration, 2-Load Configurations, 3-Display Results"

0 - will exit the program as it stands

1- Will allow you to create a configuration to use. You get options for type, data (maybe multiple depending on the service), id
TYPE: the types that you can choose from are just the normal commands: Type of Operations: PING, HTTP, HTTPS, NTP, DNS, TCP, UDP
(make sure that you use capital letters)
DATA: You have to enter each section of data. Some of them have multiples so I'll lay it out for you
PING (data = server_address), HTTP (data = server address) , HTTPS(data = server address), NTP(data = server address),
DNS(data= server address, data2 = query typ, data3 = record type), TCP(data = server address, data2 = port number),
UDP(data = server address, data2 = port)

ID: option of 1-5

2- will load all the configurations that you have saved so far and show the json data it sends(fairly simple)


3- Will begin the socket connection and results will begin displaying in the monitor_service.py
You have a couple of options once you begin displaying.
A prompt with a timeout feature will be displayed after sending each json section.
If you enter 0...the connection will pause
If you enter another ID (make sure that it's entered correctly in configurations) it will begin to display that id's information
If you begin on the same operation that was paused all of the saved data will be displayed
Too exit all you have to do is press ctrl+c!


If you are getting a sending confirmation and a received confirmation in management_service then this ensures you still have your connection
